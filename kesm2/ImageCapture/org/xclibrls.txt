    RELEASE NOTES: XCLIB  - Version 2.2

      1.  This release adds support for Windows XP.  (03-Dec-2001).

      2.  Added Feature:  Function  pxd_SV2112_setExposureAndGain  allows  setting
          the  current  exposure  and gain for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112 and 2112C
          cameras.  Function pxd_SV2112_setResolutionAndTiming allows setting  the
          current  decimation,  AOI, scan direction, and pixel clock frequency for
          the   SILICON   VIDEO(R)   2112   and    2112C    cameras.     Functions
          pxd_SV2112_getExposure,   pxd_SV2112_getGain,  pxd_SV2112_getDecimation,
          pxd_SV2112_getAoiTop,  pxd_SV2112_getAoiLeft,  pxd_SV2112_getPixelClock,
          and  pxd_SV2112_getScanDirection  allow  obtaining the eponymous setting
          for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112 and 2112C cameras.  (03-Dec-2001).

      3.  Added Feature:  A SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112 and 2112C specific example  pro-
          gram,  XCLIBEXC.CPP,  demonstrates  capture,  display, adjustment of the
          camera's settings.  (03-Dec-2001).

      4.  Fixed Feature:  The new ::goingBufStatus service may cause system termi-
          nation  when  used  with  multiple  boards, and when used on any but the
          first board.  (13-Dec-2001).

      5.  Added Feature:  For SILICON IMAGING  3170  cameras,  video  setup  files
          saved by XCAP now contain the necessary serial commands to (re)configure
          the camera.  Upon open, XCLIB now reconfigures  the  camera  with  these
          serial commands.  (18-Jan-2002).

      6.  Added       Feature:        New       functions        pxd_getGPTrigger,
          pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate,  and pxd_eventGPTriggerClose provide SCF level
          access to the software detectable trigger provided on PIXCI(R)  D,  D24,
          D32,  D2X,  and  D3X  image  boards.   Note that these functions are not
          needed when using a camera which itself is  in  trigger  mode.   Rather,
          they  can  be  used  to detect a trigger with cameras in continuous mode
          where the PIXCI(R) trigger input has  no  direct  effect  on  camera  or
          PIXCI(R) imaging board.  (01-Feb-2002).

      7.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_defineImage3 with some combinations  of  imaging
          boards and cameras would produce a program fault.  (08-Feb-2002).

      8.  Fixed Feature:  On PIXCI(R) and cameras  which  produce  more  than  one
          pixel  per  clock,  the `vidres.x.vidoffset' was interpreted in units of
          pixel clocks, instead of pixels.  (13-Feb-2002).

      9.  Fixed Feature:  The PIXCI(R) Windows VXD and SYS files,  the  XCLIB  DLL
          files,  and  the  PXIPL  DLL files did not have correct, or did not have
          any, version information shown with the files' properties (such  as  via
          the Windows Explorer).  (20-Feb-2002).

     10.  Fixed/Added Feature:  The pxd_getFieldCount function  mentioned  in  the
          Conversion  of  Application  Programs from XCOBJ was not documented.  It












                                        - 2 -



          has been renamed to pxd_videoFieldCount (a function under the  old  name
          persists  for compatibility) and documented.  The pxd_getFieldsPerFrame,
          never    mentioned    or    documented,    has    been    renamed     to
          pxd_videoFieldsPerFrame and documented.  (27-Feb-2002).

     11.  Improved/Fixed Feature:  The maximum number of bits per pixel value com-
          ponent was limited to 14, and has been changed to 16.  (09-Apr-2002).

     12.  Fixed Feature:  When switching the SV2112 camera from controlled back to
          continuous  video  mode, the pxd_SV2112_setVideoAndTriggerMode had to be
          called twice (with the same parameters).  (02-May-2002).

     13.  Improved Feature:  The XCLIBEXC.CPP example program for use with  SV2112
          and   SV2112C  cameras  now  also  demonstrates  the  implementation  of
          automatic gain control (AGC).  (05-Jul-2002)

     14.  Fixed  Feature:   Using  Forceful  Memory   allocation   under   Windows
          NT/2000/XP,  and  selecting  the  wrong boot.ini selection when prompted
          during Windows' boot, may prevent Windows from starting.  (09-Aug-2002).

     15.  Fixed Feature:  Using multiple PIXCI(R)  D2X,  D3X,  CL1  under  Windows
          2000/XP,  where the cameras are tightly synchronized may cause the PC to
          lockup until rebooted or the cameras powered down.  (12-Aug-2002).

     16.  Added Feature:  XCLIB now supports additional features of newer PIXCI(R)
          D2X,  D3X  imaging  boards for line scan cameras, increasing the maximum
          number of lines per image from 65535 to 16777216.  (15-Aug-2002).

     17.  Fixed Feature:  When using multiple PIXCI(R)  CL1  imaging  boards  with
          certain     cameras,     the    pxd_videoFieldCount    pxd_getFieldCount
          pxd_getGPTrigger functions always returned the status of unit 1, not the
          selected   unitmap,  and  the  events  created  by  pxd_eventFieldCreate
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate were signalled  by
          activity on either unit.  (22-Aug-2002).

     18.  Fixed   Feature:    On   newer   machines   under   Windows   XP,    the
          pxd_eventFieldCreate                        pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate
          pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate may cause system death  (i.e.   `blue-screen').
          (23-Aug-2002).

     19.  New Feature:  XCLIB and XCLIB-IPL for Windows now includes  static  link
          libraries,  as  an  alternative to using the dynamic link library (DLL).
          For OEM application programs that are to  be  redistributed,  using  the
          static  link libraries minimizes the number of files that must be redis-
          tributed.  (09-Sep-2002).

     20.  Improved Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf  and  pxd_goLiveTrig  now  allow
          selecting  rising, falling, or either edge of the general purpose input,
          when used with PIXCI(R) SV4, SV5, D2X,  D3X,  and  CL1  imaging  boards.
          Previously, those features always used either edge.  (09-Sep-2002).












                                        - 3 -



     21.  Improved Feature:  For PIXCI(R) D2X, D3X, or CL1 and line  scan  cameras
          running  in  `vertical  mastered' mode (i.e. no external VDRIVE signal),
          XCLIB now allows snapping an image starting at the next  line,  in  con-
          trast  to  snapping  when  the internal line counters `roll over'.  (25-
          Sep-2002).

     22.  Fixed Feature:  In the current release of XCLIB, the  `controlled'  mode
          parameters        of        pxd_SV2112_setVideoAndTriggerMode        and
          pxd_SV2112_setCtrlExposureAndRate may not work  as  intended.   (04-Oct-
          2002).

     23.  Added Feature:  A new example, XCLIBEX4.CPP, demonstrates sequence  cap-
          ture and display with any PIXCI(R) imaging board.  (11-Oct-2002)

     24.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_readuchar, pxd_writeuchar,  pxd_readushort,  and
          pxd_writeushort    as    well   as   the   similar   ::imageWriteUShort,
          ::imageReadUShort,  ::imageWriteUChar,  and  ::imageReadUChar  functions
          would return 0 and read/write nothing if the specified AOI were invalid,
          such as larger than the frame buffer.  (15-Oct-2002).

     25.  Fixed Feature:  The ::bufferSaveStream and ::bufferLoadStream  functions
          may  cause  program  death when the alignsector parameter is non-zero in
          conjunction with certain combinations of cameras,  imaging  boards,  and
          operating systems.  (16-Oct-2002).

     26.  Improved Feature:  The pxd_defineImage, pxd_defineImage3, pxd_readuchar,
          pxd_writeuchar,   pxd_readushort,   and  pxd_writeushort  now  accept  a
          colorspace of `CbYCrY' to access pixel data in  UYVY  format,  supported
          only  with   a PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, or SV5 which has been set to cap-
          ture in that format.  (28-Oct-2002).

     27.  New Feature:  A beta version of XCLIB for  the  Linux  2.4.8  kernel  is
          released.  (01-Nov-2002)

     28.  Modified Feature:  The default frame buffer memory  size  under  Windows
          NT,  2000, and XP has been increased from 4 Mbyte to 16 Mbyte.  (05-Nov-
          2002).

     29.  Fixed Feature:  For some combinations of  PIXCI(R)  imaging  boards  and
          cameras, use of pxd_defineImage3 selecting fewer than all frame buffers,
          combined with pxio8_binreadseq,  pxio8_binwriteseq,  pxio8_bin1writeseq,
          and  pxio8_bin1readseq would result saving or loading more frame buffers
          than specified.  (13-Nov-2002).

     30.  Improved Feature:  Under Windows NT, 2000, or XP the `-WT' driver confi-
          guration  parameter  now allows selecting a high resolution kernel timer
          for time stamping events.  (28-Nov-2002)

     31.  Fixed Feature:  On some machines and cameras under Windows 2000 and  XP,
          the           pxd_eventFieldCreate          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate












                                        - 4 -



          pxd_eventGPTriggerCreate may cause system death.  (16-Dec-2002).

     32.  Added Feature:  The Camera Link serial API has been added to XCLIB, with
          functions  clSerialInit, clSerialClose, clSerialRead, and clSerialWrite.
          These allow access to a PIXCI(R) imaging board which was already  opened
          by XCLIB.  A separate DLL, clSerPIXCI.dll which has only the Camera Link
          Serial API, and can be distributed w/out XCLIB's licensing restrictions,
          can  be  used  to  access  the serial port PIXCI(R) imaging boards w/out
          XCLIB.  (24-Dec-2002)

     33.  Fixed Feature:  When using 3 or more PIXCI(R) imaging  boards  that  are
          combinations  of  at least 2 different models (such as D vs SV4 vs D2X),
          certain combinations of selected boards (via -DM) when installed in cer-
          tain order on the PCI bus may cause errors upon open.  (13-Jan-2003)

     34.  Fixed  Feature:   The  pxd_setExsyncPrin,   pxd_setExsyncPrincMode   and
          related  functions  were  not  enabled  for use with the PIXCI(R) CL3SD.
          (31-Jan-2003)

     35.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112(C) when used in Controlled
          mode,    the    maximum    frame    rate    allowed    such    as    via
          pxd_SV2112_setCtrlExposureAndRate has been corrected (increased).   (04-
          Feb-2003).

     36.  Fixed Feature:  Driver installation under Windows XP has been  improved,
          eliminating the problem under some PC configurations whereby the initial
          Plug&Play installation run's `forever', requiring a reboot and a  second
          installation.  (20-Feb-2003).

     37.  Added     Feature:      Functions      pxd_SV1310_setExposureGainOffset,
          pxd_SV1310_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other  related functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1310  and  1310C  cam-
          eras.  (28-Feb-2003)

     38.  Improved  Feature:   The  pxd_SV2112  functions,  and   especially   the
          pxd_SV2112_get  functions, have been improved and are now faster by vir-
          tue of caching the camera's state rather  than  having  to  re-read  the
          information from the camera.  (05-Mar-2003).

     39.  Fixed Feature:  When the PIXCI(R) D2X, D3X, or CL1 is  used  in  (video)
          triggered  mode  combined  with pxd_goLive, the first triggered image is
          now captured, rather than capture starting  with  the  second  triggered
          image.  (05-Apr-2003).

     40.  Fixed    Feature:     The    subsample    parameter    to    the     new
          pxd_SV1310_setResolutionAndTiming function had the horizontal and verti-
          cal subsampling components exchanged.  Thus subsample=0x0402 would  have
          implemented  horizontal subsampling by a factor of two and vertical sub-
          sampling by a factor of four, rather than the documented horizontal sub-
          sampling  by  a  factor  of four and vertical subsampling by a factor of












                                        - 5 -



          two.  (11-Apr-2003).

     41.  Improved Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1310 camera, the frame  rate
          can  now  be  increased by using subsampling and/or using a smaller AOI.
          Previously, only a smaller AOI would increase the frame rate.   (11-Apr-
          2003)

     42.  Fixed Feature:  Using a `struct pximage3' with operations that  read  or
          write  across  image  boundaries with a single read or write, the result
          may be incorrect.  The only known library function that this affected is
          pxio8_binreadseq.  (11-Jun-2003)

     43.  Added Feature:  A new example program, xclibex5.cpp, demonstrates use of
          non  pxd_  functions  to operate two imaging boards at different resolu-
          tions.  (06-Jun-2003)

     44.  Fixed Feature:  For the PIXCI(R) CL3SD,  under  Windows  2000,  XP,  the
          improved driver installation file, epixxcw2.inf, set

                   PIXCI= ... -WT -0x20

          to activate high resolution  timestamps.   The  superfluous  `-'  causes
          software  to believe the board has 4 Gbytes of memory, regardless of the
          amount of memory actually installed.  (27-Jun-2003).

     45.  Fixed Feature:  The pximage's optional PXUNIT* constants (which describe
          the  image's  real-world dimensional units) have been corrected; the old
          values did not fit within the uchar fields provided, namely  widthunits,
          heightunits, and depthunits.  (13-Jul-2003)

     46.  Added Feature:  The pxd_goSnapPair has been added as an SCF  version  of
          ::setSnapPairBuf;  both  intended  for  use with cameras that output two
          images with a single trigger.  (29-Jul-2003)

     47.  Added Feature:  The pxd_goLiveSeqTrig allows initiating  or  terminating
          sequence capture in response to a general purpose input or trigger, with
          less latency than possible with previously available  techniques.   (03-
          Aug-2003)

     48.  Fixed Feature:  For PIXCI(R) D, D24, D32, D2X, and D3X  imaging  boards,
          the  pxd_goLiveTrig and ::setLiveTrigBuf optional parameters delay60 and
          delay70 would implement the stated delay plus 1, rather than the  stated
          delay.   Note  that  these  functions are rarely used with those imaging
          boards, as they are only used with cameras that don't implement trigger-
          ing within the camera.  (07-Aug-2003).

     49.  Modified Feature:  Due to lack of apparent  interest,  the  static  link
          libraries  for  Windows  are no longer distributed with XCLIB and XCLIB-
          IPL.  (19-Aug-2003).













                                        - 6 -



     50.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now performs a power-up initialization for SIL-
          ICON  VIDEO(R) 2112 and 1310 cameras upon calling pxd_PIXCIopen.  Previ-
          ously, the cameras were initialized only by PC power-up.  (12-Sep-2003)

     51.  Fixed Feature:  Under Windows NT, 2000,  and  XP,  when  using  multiple
          instances   of   XCLIB   (via   multiple   calls   to  xclib_open),  the
          pxd_eventFieldCreate,              pxd_eventFieldClose,              and
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate   could  not  be  used  in  more  than  one
          instance.  (13-Sep-2003).

     52.  Added     Feature:      Functions      pxd_SV1281_setExposureGainOffset,
          pxd_SV1281_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other  related functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1281  and  1281C  cam-
          eras.  (16-Sep-2003).

     53.  Fixed Feature:  On some PC's, the SILICON  VIDEO(R)  1310(C)  would  not
          initialize  properly  after  power  up,  outputting a grey image, unless
          either (a) XCAP was run, or (b) The XCLIB  application  was  run  twice.
          (29-Sep-2003).

     54.  Improved Feature:  The PIXCI(R) SV5A  is  now  supported  distinct  from
          PIXCI(R)  SV5;  the  default  SV5A  video  setup  is NTSC, not the SV5's
          NTSC/YC.  (30-Sep-2003).

     55.  Improved Feature:  For all currently supported  Uniq,  Basler,  Hitachi,
          and  Cohu  CameraLink  cameras  and the Jai CV-M4+CL/CV-M7+CL CameraLink
          cameras video setup files saved by XCAP now include the serial  commands
          needed  to  restore  the  camera  to  the operating mode as set in XCAP.
          XCLIB now loads those serial commands during pxd_PIXCIopen,  eliminating
          having  to follow the instructions in the Using a Serial (RS-232) Confi-
          gurable Camera with the PIXCI(R) D, D24, D32, D2X, D3X,  CL1,  or  CL3SD
          application  note.   The  same  improvement has always been provided for
          Silicon Imaging and Redlake ES-1020 cameras, but not  explicitly  noted.
          (27-Oct-2003).

     56.  Improved Feature:  Under Linux, the `Use Polling Rather than  Interrupts
          (-QU)' option is now available.  (12-Nov-2003).

     57.  Fixed Feature:  Under Linux, closing the library  may  cause  the  wrong
          (library  internal)  file `handle' to the driver to be closed, adversely
          affecting any file or device  opened  after  XCLIB.   Under  Linux,  the
          pxd_loadBmp does not work properly.  (09-Dec-2003).

     58.  Added Feature:  Functions pxd_definePximage and  pxd_definePximage3  and
          similar  to  the existing pxd_defineImage and pxd_defineImage3, but more
          convenient in multi-threaded and a few other, rare, applications.   (06-
          Jan-2004)

     59.  Fixed Feature:  Under Linux, on some motherboards, interrupts, and  thus
          notification about end-of-capture, may not work properly.  (14-Jan-2004)












                                        - 7 -



     60.  Added Feature:  A new example program, XCLIBEX6.TXT, illustrates use  of
          XCLIB with VB.NET.  (16-Jan-2004).

     61.  Added Feature:  New functions pxd_saveRawBuffers and  pxd_loadRawBuffers
          have  been  added  as an SCF version of ::bufferLoadStream and ::buffer-
          SaveStream.  (02-Feb-2004)

     62.  Fixed Feature:  When using XCLIBEXC.CPP and a SILICON  VIDEO(R)  1310(C)
          with  a  video  setup file saved by XCAP which sets a small capture AOI,
          the captured image is garbled as the camera is  set  to  one  resolution
          while  the  SILICON  VIDEO(R)  1310(C)  specific  functions  invoked  by
          XCLIBEXC.CPP set the PIXCI(R) imaging board to a  different  resolution.
          (The  same  video  setup file works correctly in XCLIBEX2.CPP which does
          not make use of SILICON VIDEO(R) 1310(C) specific functions).   (31-Mar-
          2004).

     63.  Improved Feature:  New function pxd_mesgFaultText allows  obtaining  the
          text   describing   a   fault   from  a  SCF  style  function,  avoiding
          pxd_mesgFault's implied creation of a message box.  (12-Apr-2004).

     64.  Fixed Feature:  For Camera Link cameras where a previously  saved  video
          setup file contains serial commands with which to initialize the camera,
          XCLIB's pxd_PIXCIopen may fail with a `timeout' error.  The  problem  is
          most  likely to occur under Linux, but might occur under other operating
          systems.  (30-Apr-2004).

     65.  Improved Feature:  The XCLIB release now includes the full  XCLIB  C/C++
          Reference Manual in HTML format.  (07-May-2004).

     66.  Fixed Feature:  For rare combinations of frame buffer sizes versus frame
          buffer  memory allocation parameters, the per-buffer capture information
          reported    by    pxd_buffersFieldCount,    pxd_buffersSysTicks,     and
          pxd_buffersGPIn  may  be  destroyed  by capturing into the last, or last
          few, frame buffers.  (11-May-2004).

     67.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1281 and 1281C cameras, in some
          combinations of AOI, pixel clock and other parameters, too large a value
          of exposure is allowed, causing the captured image to be extremely  dark
          or  extremely  bright.   Also,  under Visual Basic or Delphi a divide by
          zero error may occur when the camera was not previously used  by  a  `C'
          application or XCAP.  (27-May-2004).

     68.  Fixed Feature:  For SILICON VIDEO(R) 1281 and 1281C cameras, the maximum
          exposure  as  a function of other parameters, and some internal `tweaks'
          governing timing was not consistent with XCAP.  (17-Jun-2004).

     69.  Improved Feature:  For all currently supported  DVC  CameraLink  cameras
          video  setup  files saved by XCAP now include the serial commands needed
          to restore the camera to the operating mode as set in XCAP.   See  entry
          for 27-Oct-2003 for additional information.  (11-Aug-2004).

     70.  Added Feature:  Supports the SILICON VIDEO(R) 9M001 and 9M001C  cameras,
          including  utilizing video setup files saved by XCAP to restore the cam-
          era state.  But does not yet have camera specific API  functions.   (19-
          Sep-2004).

     71.  Added Feature:  Access to color pixel values  now  supports  CMY  (cyan,
          magenta, yellow) color space.  (21-Sep-2004).

     72.  Corrected.  Documentation for  pxd_loadBmp  and  pxd_loadTiff  has  been
          corrected  to  describe the existing 0x100 option to loadmode.  (25-Oct-
          2004).

     73.  Added      Feature:       Functions      pxd_SV9M001_setExposureAndGain,
          pxd_SV9M001_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other related functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 9M001 and 9M001C  cam-
          eras.  (25-Oct-2004).

     74.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now  recognizes  and  supports  Windows  Server
          2003.  (29-Nov-2004)

     75.  Fixed Feature:  For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1281 and 1281C cameras and when
          using  a  video  setup file in non-free run mode.  The call to the first
          pxd_SV1281_*() function may change the video setup.  Previous workaround
          was to call pxd_videoFormatAsIncluded after the pxd_SV1281_*() function.
          (09-Dec-2004)

     76.  Fixed Feature:  For SILICON VIDEO(R) and other  cameras  configured  for
          per-pixel  offset  and  gain  corrections, when a) Using forceful memory
          allocation, b) Driver configuration parameter -MB non-zero, and c) Frame
          buffer  mmeory  mapped into application space, the per-pixel corrections
          may not be applied correctly.  (22-Dec-2004)

     77.  Improved Documentation:  For the pxd_SV2112_, pxd_SV1310_,  pxd_SV1281_,
          and  pxd_SV9M001_  functions, documentation now notes that pxd_PIXCIopen
          performs partial, quick initialization of  ;  initialization  for  these
          camera  functions  is  delayed  until the first such function is called.
          Time sensitive applications should call any of  these  camera  functions
          once  before  entering  the application's time critical phase.  (23-Dec-
          2004)

     78.  Fixed Feature:  Use of clserPIXCI.DLL (the stand-alone Camera Link  API)
          failed under Windows 95, 98 if the PIXCI(R) was not previously opened by
          XCLIB or XCAP.  (06-Jan-2005)

     79.  Added      Feature:       Functions      pxd_SV9M001_setExposureAndGain,
          pxd_SV9M001_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other related functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 9T001C  camera.   (27-
          Feb-2005).














                                        - 9 -



     80.  Improved Feature:  The clserPIXCI.DLL (the stand-alone Camera Link  API)
          has  been  renamed to clserEPX.dll, and is now compliant with the Camera
          Link V1.1 specification.  (12-May-2005).

     81.  Improved Feature:  The pxd_xclibEscape now returns NULL if  the  library
          is not open.  (12-May-2005)

     82.  Fixed Feature:  The Linux version of the PIXCI(R) driver  did  not  work
          with the (very) old PIXCI(R) SV2 and SV3 imaging boards.  (25-Jun-2005)

     83.  Fixed Feature:  In beta releases of XCLIB w. support  for  the  PIXCI(R)
          CL2, the pxd_serialConfigure would ONLY work with the CL2, not the older
          CL1, CL3SD, etc.  (27-Jun-2005).

     84.  Improved Feature:  The data rate of the I2C or two wire serial bus  used
          to  control  SILICON  VIDEO(R) camera heads can now be increased via the
          `-I2C' Device Configuration Parameters so as to allow faster control  of
          gain and other camera head features when used with shorter cables.  This
          feature is particularly useful with 9T001C cameras, whose camera  head's
          control  involves  more  I2C  or two wire serial bus activity than other
          SILICON VIDEO(R) camera heads.  (04-Aug-2005).

     85.  Added Feature:  Now supports Linix 2.6.x kernels.  (03-Oct-2005).

     86.  Added Feature:  Supports the SILICON VIDEO(R)  642M  and  642C  cameras,
          including  utilizing video setup files saved by XCAP to restore the cam-
          era        state.         Functions        pxd_SV640_setExposureAndGain,
          pxd_SV640_setResolutionAndTiming  and  other  related  functions provide
          camera specific controls for the SILICON VIDEO(R) 642M and 642C cameras.
          (23-Nov-2005).

     87.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_readuchar  and  pxd_readushort  functions,  when
          used  to  read  an  AOI  of the image with one function call, under some
          memory configurations may return incorrect pixel data.  (22-Dec-2005).

     88.  Modified Feature:  The file name  of  32  bit  Linux  drivers  has  been
          changed from pixcii86.o or pixcii86.ko to pixci_i386.o or pixci_i386.ko.
          This will avoid confusion with new 64 bit Linux  drivers,  to  be  named
          pixci_x86_64.ko.   (The  i386  or  x86_64  file name components are con-
          sistent with `uname -i').  (30-Jan-2006).

     89.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) CL1 Rev. 3.  An older
          XCLIB  used  with a PIXCI(R) CL1 Rev. 3 is not be able to correctly pro-
          gram the Camera Link serial baud rate.  (07-Feb-2006)

     90.  Improved Feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) E1, PCI Express imag-
          ing board.  (20-Feb-2006)

    RELEASE NOTES: XCLIB  - Version 2.1

      1.  This release supports the PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, D,  D24,  D32,  and  A
          models,   in   Watcom+Tenberry   extended   32   bit  DOS,  and  Windows
          95/98/NT/2000 environments.  Though not documented, the 95/98 driver and
          library also works in Windows ME.  (28-Aug-2000).

      2.  Added feature:  An additional forceful memory  allocation  method  added
          for  Windows  ME using the -IA driver configuration parameter in similar
          manner as for Windows NT.  (01-Sep-2000).

      3.  Fixed feature:  The default format (pixels per  clock)  for  the  Pulnix
          TMC-9700 is incorrect.  (04-Sep-2000)

      4.  Fixed feature:  Using pxd_getGPOut or its  non-SCF  counterpart  with  a
          PIXCI(R) D,  D24,  D32,  or A and certain Kodak 10 bit cameras may cause
          loss of the 2 least significant bits.  (7-Sep-2000).

      5.  Fixed  documentation:   Documentation   for   pxd_renderDirectVideoInit,
          pxd_renderDirectVideoDone,         pxd_renderDirectVideoLive,        and
          pxd_renderDirectVideoUnLive  showed  these  functions  as  being   named
          pxd_DirectVideoInit,   pxd_DirectVideoDone,   pxd_DirectVideoLive,   and
          pxd_DirectVideoUnLive.  The library  and  .h  files  are  not  affected.
          (15-Sep-2000).

      6.  Fixed feature:  The default format for the Dalsa CA-D4  was  incorrectly
          set as if for a line scan camera.  (19-Sep-2000).

      7.  Fixed documentation:  The documentation for pxd_goLiveSeq also  referred
          to  a  `pxd_goSnapSeq' function; the `pxd_goSnapSeq' was a typographical
          error and should have been pxd_goLiveSeq.  (28-Sep-2000).

      8.  Added feature:  Support for using interlace cameras with the PIXCI(R) D,
          D24,  D32  added with support for snap, live, and sequence capture.  The
          ::setLiveTrigBuf does not yet support interlace modes.  (29-Sep-2000)

      9.  Fixed release:  Versions of XCLIB for Windows NT  w/out  PXIPL  did  not
          included  the EPIXXCWT.SYS driver and related files.  These files can be
          obtained from the XCAP release.  (03-Nov-2000)

     10.  Added feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) D2X  series  of  imaging
          boards.  (06-Nov-2000)

     11.  Fixed documentation:  The documentation for the reserved period  parame-
          ter of ::setLivePairBuf specified that its value should be 0.  The value
          should be 1.  (09-Nov-2000).

     12.  Added feature:  The  pxd_defineImage,  pxd_defineImage3,  pxd_readuchar,
          pxd_readushort,  pxd_writeuchar,  and  pxd_writeushort now accept `GRAY'
          and `Gray' as a synonyms for `Grey', and now accept `Bayer' for  use  in












                                        - 11 -



          conjunction  with cameras that actually output raw Bayer pattern values,
          and where the library would otherwise be responsible for converting  the
          values to RGB(x) or BGR(x).  (22-Dec-2000).

     13.  Modified feature:  For Bayer output cameras, the `Default' pixel  format
          is  now  BGR  rather  than  RGB,  for  better  display  performance when
          `Default' is requested.  (Does not affect code that explicitly requested
          BGR format).  (01-Jan-2001).

     14.  Fixed feature:  A Driver Configuration  Parameter  of  `-XM'=0  (a  non-
          default value) did not work properly with multiple boards installed.

             With multiple boards, one of which having a configuration error while
          others  are  selected  for  actual  use, may result in a spurious `Can't
          allocate frame buffer memory' error.  (02-Jan-2001).

     15.  Fixed Feature:  The pxd_defineImage3 did  not  accept  a  colorspace  of
          `Default' (the pxd_defineImage was not affected).  (13-Jan-2001).

     16.  Fixed  Feature:   The  pxd_defineImage  and  pxd_defineImage3  area   of
          interest  selection  may  or  may not have the correct effect, depending
          upon the function with which  the  pxd_defineImage  or  pxd_defineImage3
          result is used (a new bug only in previous release).  (13-Jan-2001).

     17.  Added Feature:  The pxd_defineImage and pxd_defineImage3  now  accept  a
          colorspace  of  `Display', which provides the most efficient color space
          for display of the frame  buffer  through  pxio8_GDIDisplay  or  similar
          functions.  (13-Jan-2001).

     18.  Fixed Feature:  Using forceful memory allocation under Windows NT,  Win-
          dows  2000,  or  DOS  with  a PIXCI(R) SV4 would result in unpredictable
          behavior the second time (since  booting)  that  the  board  is  opened.
          (16-Jan-2001).

     19.  Fixed Feature:  Calling pxd_goLiveSeq or ::setLiveSeqBuf while a  previ-
          ous  pxd_goLiveSeq or ::setLiveSeqBuf was in operation did not alter the
          numbuf setting .  (17-Jan-2001)

     20.  Added Feature:  XCLIB now supports the two G.P In and two G.P  Out  bits
          for the PIXCI(R) D2X series of imaging boards.  (24-Jan-2001).

     21.  Fixed Feature:  For PIXCI(R) SV4 imaging boards in ::setLiveSeqBuf mode,
          a  ::getLiveStatus  using  PXVIST_RUNNING  always  returned 0.  (31-Jan-
          2001).

     22.  Added        Feature:         The        pxd_eventFieldCreate        and
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate allow the application to be signalled via a
          Windows event at the start of each field, and/or at the end of each cap-
          tured    field.     Under    Tenberry+DOS,    pxd_eventFieldCreate   and
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate allow specifying a `callback'  function  to












                                        - 12 -



          be  invoked  at  the start of each field, and/or at the end of each cap-
          tured field.  (06-Feb-2001).

     23.  Improved Feature:  A new EPIXXCW2.SYS driver for Windows  2000  provides
          better   compatibility  with  newer  motherboards.   In  particular,  it
          resolves a problem with motherboards using early  800  series  chipsets,
          which  would  not provide interrupts.  The older EPIXXCWT.SYS driver for
          Windows NT may still be used under Windows 2000 on all  previously  sup-
          ported motherboards.  (20-Feb-2001).

     24.  Fixed feature:  The default format  for  the  SMD  4M15  was  incorrect.
          (27-Mar-2001).

     25.  Added Feature:  New function pxd_setExsyncPrincMode,  pxd_getExsyncMode,
          and  pxd_getPrincMode  allow  setting camera configuration bits, but not
          suggested for use in favor of loading a new video configuration format.

             New service pxd_videoFormatAsIncluded allows configuring XCLIB as per
          a  video  configuration  format that has been compiled into the applica-
          tion, and without re-opening XCLIB.  (01-Apr-2001).

     26.  Fixed Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf used with a  PIXCI(R)  SV4  imaging
          board did not always set the `gpout60value' or `gpout80value' correctly.
          (08-May-2001)

     27.  Added Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf is now supported for  the  PIXCI(R)
          D2X imaging boards.  (09-May-2001).

     28.  Added feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) CL1  series  of  imaging
          boards  for  Camera  Link  cameras.   New functions pxd_serialConfigure,
          pxd_serialRead, and pxd_serialWrite support  reading  and  writing  data
          through the PIXCI(R) CL1.  (15-May-2001).

     29.  Fixed feature:   Under  Windows  NT  and  2000,  the  event  created  by
          pxd_eventFieldCreate  and pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate is initially sig-
          nalled; thus the first WaitForSingleObject would always  return  immedi-
          ately.    For   PIXCI(R)  D2X  imaging  boards,  the  event  created  by
          pxd_eventCapturedFieldCreate behaved the same as  an  event  created  by
          pxd_eventFieldCreate.  (18-May-2001).

     30.  Added Feature:  The XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) SV5  imaging  board.
          (29-May-2001).

     31.  Fixed Feature:  Under Windows 2000, the PIXCI(R) SV5 would appear as two
          devices, (1) The SV5, and (2) A (18-Jun-2001).

     32.  Added Feature:  The XCLIB now support  opening  multiple,  simultaneous,
          instances  of  the  library;  allowing  use  of multiple, non-identical,
          PIXCI(R) imaging boards.  The multiple instances must be opened from the
          same   process,   with  multi-thread  synchronization  provided  by  the

          application program.  (01-Jul-2001).

     33.  Fixed Feature:  The new  pxd_serialWrite  did  not  function  correctly.
          (03-Jul-2001).

     34.  Modified feature:  For PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4,  and  SV5,  for  PAL  and
          CCIR,  the default video setup has been changed to avoid capturing black
          lines at the top of the image.  (06-Jul-2001).

     35.  Fixed Feature:  When using Forceful Memory allocation under  Windows  NT
          or  2000,  the  frame  buffer  memory  would not be cleared when Windows
          booted.  Rather, the memory, or  a  portion  of  the  memory,  would  be
          cleared each time the library/driver was opened.  (18-Jul-2001).

     36.  Fixed Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf did not work with the PIXCI(R) D2X,
          causing program or PC hang-ups.  (20-Jul-2001).

     37.  Modified  feature:   The  size  of   the   serial   data   buffers   for
          pxd_serialRead  and pxd_serialWrite have been increased from 32 bytes to
          1024 bytes.  (28-Jul-2001).

     38.  Fixed Feature:  For PIXCI(R) D, D24, D32, D2X, or CL1, specifying  video
          resolution  `setmaxdatsamples'  or  `setmaxvidsamples' with insufficient
          frame buffer memory to  achieve  maximum  resolution  would  (correctly)
          cause  the  `setmax...samples'  to be overridden and a less than maximum
          resolution to be used.  However, the X & Y resolution  used,  trading  X
          resolution for Y resolution, would not be consistent.  (05-Aug-2001).

     39.  Fixed Feature:  Trying to open a imaging board while already in  use  by
          an  earlier  application  correctly  produced  an error, but incorrectly
          closed the imaging board and deprived the  earlier  application  of  its
          use.  (13-Aug-2001).

     40.  Fixed Feature:  Support for opening  multiple,  non-identical,  PIXCI(R)
          imaging  boards  was  not  fully  included  in Windows NT/2000 versions.
          (17-Aug-2001).

     41.  Added  Feature:   New  functions  pxd_buffersFieldCount  pxd_buffersGPIn
          pxd_buffersSysTicks  provide  the  time and value of the general purpose
          inputs for each captured buffer.  (16-Sep-2001).

     42.  Added Feature:  New function pxd_goLiveTrig allows using  ::setLiveTrig-
          Buf within the SCF functions.  (25-Sep-2001).

     43.  Fixed Feature:  The ::setLiveTrigBuf did not work with the PIXCI(R) D2X,
          causing the `wait for g.p. input' to never be satisfied.  (05-Oct-2001).

     44.  Fixed   Feature:    The   colorspace   parameter    of    pxd_readuchar,
          pxd_writeuchar  and similar functions is documented as allowing a selec-
          tion of `YCrCb', `YofYCrCb', `RofYCrCb', and `BofYCrCb', but the library












                                        - 14 -



          instead   required  `YCRCB',  `YofYCRCB',  `RofYCRCB',  and  `BofYCRCB'.
          Either `YCRCB' or `YCrCb', and their variants, are  now  allowed.   (05-
          Oct-2001)

     45.  Fixed Feature:  The ::importStateCopy  and  ::exportStateCopy,  and  the
          third  parameter  of  pxd_PIXCIopen  did  not always work properly under
          Watcom+Tenberry.  (24-Oct-2001).

     46.  Modified Feature:  A twelfth  parameter,  trackers  has  been  added  to
          ::setLiveSeqBuf; existing code should simply add a final parameter of 0.
          (28-Oct-2001).

     47.  Added feature:  XCLIB now supports the PIXCI(R) D3X  series  of  imaging
          boards.  (Oct-2001)

     48.  Added Feature:  XCLIB now supports the G.P. In and G.P.  Out  bits  that
          have  been  added  to  newer  released of PIXCI(R) CL1 boards.  (12-Nov-
          2001).


    RELEASE NOTES: XCLIB  - Version 0.0 Beta

      1.  Fixed  Feature.   The  pxd_readuchar,  pxd_writeuchar,   pxd_readushort,
          pxd_writeushort,  as  well  as their ::imageReadUChar, ::imageWriteUChar
          ::imageReadUShort, ::imageWriteUShort equivalents do not  work  properly
          on an image AOI.  (27-Jun-2000).
